Title: 
INTELLIGENT DECISION SYSTEMS IN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES: IMPLEMENTATION USING A SCALED VEHICLE

Abstract:
Autonomous vehicles, while not yet fully robust, are gaining popularity due to their potential to 
enhance transportation safety and efficacy. However, the increase in accidents involving immature 
autonomous driving systems highlights the necessity of improving their functionalities. This reportâ€™s 
practical approach delves into autonomous vehicles' decision-making systems, providing a 
comprehensive understanding of their architecture and a thorough analysis of their traffic accidents 
to uncover insights that contribute to developing more robust and reliable autonomous driving 
solutions.
